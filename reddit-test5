However, registering a business in my country (Ukraine) comes with certain drawbacks: unstable banking conditions (because of war) and relatively high initial taxes.\n\nIf I decide to go another route \u2014 for example, by renting an account from someone who already has a registered business or a verified payment system \u2014 what important things should I consider?

        "body": "Hello, I would like to ask about your experience and advice regarding imports from China or Asia. Me and my friends would like to start own business venture and we see a big potential in pricing, production capabilities as well as tech advancements.\n\nWhat I\u2019m curious about can be broken down into following categories:\n\n1.) Category of products:\nAs stupid as it sounds, I would like to know what the best categories of products to source are. For me, electronics/tech comes to mind as first. They are way ahead and progressing. I was intrigued by products such as LED smart film, LED transparent film or other tech that I don\u2019t see present in EU markets or at least in my county\u2019s market (small country in central europe - 5 million people). A lot of the tech however, is so niche, that market might be so behind, it wouldn\u2019t accept it (or need to be educated), market is too small or the the price sensitivity is too high. The question is, did you import something totally new and still breakthrough? I feel like its not worth importing something like furniture or other heavy cargo which could turn into logistics nightmare. But maybe there is something worth it.\n\n2.) Sourcing:\nOkay, lets assume we find the right category, specific products and we start to search for supplier. What are the best practices to find honest, helpful supplier? I understand that platforms such as Alibaba and similar are full of middlemen, agents and low-quality scammers. The best way is the find manufacturer that has experience with imports to western countries. That means they have (or should have) experience with dealing with western companies. They should have proper certification and documentation. My question is, how do you find and approach them. Is it through expos such as Canton Fair or product-specific ones? Email them directly? Find chinese agents to find your desired product? And after you do, what are the best practices to negotiate with such supplier in terms of MOQs, pricing, exclusivity? I understand that establishing proper relationship with Asian supplier is crucial as it can save a lot of trouble moving forward (logistics, compliance, made-to-measure solutions).\n\n3.) Logitstics;\nThis is a crucial part of success of the bussiness venture. I would like to know you experience of what are the best practices. What Intercoms is the best to negotiate, what might go south, what risks vs profit is worth to try etc. \n\n\nPlease, Im asking as young entrepreneur with background in marketing and operations. I would like to know what hardships and experience someone went through with similar business. I would like to avoid replies such as: \u201cIf you have to ask on Reddit, you wont be successful\u201d or \u201cGo get a job, learn something and then slowly build your business\u201d. Any advice and experience will be valued. Thank you in advance! ",

        "body": "Just wanted to share something that might help some of you out here.\n\nI recently helped a small business client who was stuck in a pretty frustrating situation with their payment processor. They were getting nailed with surprise fees over $2,100 in total, and no matter how many times they tried to cancel, they kept getting brushed off with excuses like \u201chigh demand\u201d and left on hold forever.\n\nWe finally decided enough was enough and moved them over to a new processor that was more transparent and small-business-friendly. Setup went way smoother than we expected, and they\u2019ve been able to focus on growing the biz instead of constantly dealing with payment drama.\n\nIt really opened my eyes to how important it is for small business owners to *not* just \u201cset it and forget it\u201d when it comes to payment systems. Fees add up fast, and bad service can seriously drain time and energy.\n\nHave any of you gone through something similar? What payment processors or tools have worked (or not worked) for your businesses? Would love to hear what\u2019s been saving you money or keeping things running smoothly.",

We don\u2019t display any personal information, no names , photos or gender. You choose the characters we designed which suits your core personality, fill specially curated questions and GET YOUR PROFILE CARD. That\u2019s it.\n\nThen you go Home page and see profile cards of people in radius of 10km around you. You are finding one-one people instead of all anonymous platforms that are just useless polls or expressive platforms to troll. \n\nDouble tap to add them in your deck and chat with them or swipe up to see new profiles. \n\n\nOur aim is very simple: platform to find niche cool people around you and go out and actually hangout with them. \n\nThis is just our version 1 , we have big plans for future but first we\u2019d like to test the core idea behind it. \n\nAs of now we are Close testing in 4 cities \nPUNE , Mumbai , Bangalore and Tirchy. \n\nFollow the link to download the app. \nIt\u2019s on AppStore ( Clique social ) playstore process is still going on. \n\nhttps://linktr.ee/downloadCLIQUE\n\nMy social handles- \nInsta : https://www.instagram.com/umangbhavar__?igsh=Zjl4MXc5dHo3djll&amp;utm_source=qr\n\n\nPls try it out and let me know what you think. \nMy dms are always open. \n\n",
